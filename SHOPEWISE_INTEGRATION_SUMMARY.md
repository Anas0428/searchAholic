  - Search functionality
  - Error handling and retry logic

## Benefits

### ✅ Shared Authentication
- Users can login to either app with the same credentials
- Single sign-on experience
- Centralized user management

### ✅ Data Coherency
- Products added in one app appear instantly in the other
- Real-time inventory updates
- Consistent data across platforms

### ✅ User Isolation
- Each user's data remains separate and secure
- No data leakage between users
- Proper access control

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Existing local file system maintained
- Smooth transition for current users
- No data loss during migration

## Usage Instructions

### For New Users
1. Register using the registration screen
2. Email verification required
3. Automatic profile creation in Firebase
4. Instant access to shared product database

### For Existing Users
1. Login with existing credentials
2. Data automatically synced to Firebase
3. Local files maintained for compatibility
4. Seamless transition to shared system

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```dart
// Login
final result = await AuthService.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
  email: email,
  password: password,
);

// Registration
final result = await AuthService.signUpWithEmailAndPassword(
  email: email,
  password: password,
  fullName: fullName,
);
```

### Product Operations
```dart
// Add Product
await ProductService.addProduct(
  name: 'Medicine Name',
  price: 25.99,
  quantity: 100,
  type: 'Pain Relief',
  category: 'Tablet',
);

// Real-time Stream
ProductService.getProductsStream().listen((products) {
  // Handle real-time updates
});
```

## Security Features
- Firebase Authentication handles all security
- Firestore security rules ensure data isolation
- Encrypted data transmission
- Secure user session management

## Next Steps
1. Test the integration by creating accounts in both apps
2. Add products in one app and verify they appear in the other
3. Test real-time synchronization features
4. Monitor Firebase console for usage analytics

The integration is now complete and both apps will work coherently with shared authentication and database systems.
